# HiveMQ Swarm Licenses

Place your `license.slic` in this directory.
Files that do not end with `.slic` are ignored.

If no valid license is placed in this directory, HiveMQ Swarm will start in TRIAL mode,
which restricts the maximum amount of simulated clients to 25 and disables clustering capabilities.

If you wish to obtain a HiveMQ Swarm license contact sales@hivemq.com.
